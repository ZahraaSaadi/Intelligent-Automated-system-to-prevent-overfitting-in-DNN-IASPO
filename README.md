# Intelligent-Automated-system-to-prevent-overfitting-in-DNN-IASPO
The proposed system, named “Intelligent Automated System to Prevent Overfitting ( IASPO )  in DNN” which develop intelligent approach based random search,
Bayesian optimization, and hyperband optimization algorithms to select the best hyperparameter automatically
after passing the regularization methods (L1, L2, L1L2, and dropout) as selectable hyperparameters in each layer
to guarantee the elimination of overfitting and optimize the accuracy of testing observed data.
